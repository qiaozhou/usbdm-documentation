 \page configuringCFVxPage CodeWarrior - ColdFire V7.x
 
   As of USBDM V4.9.3a the USBDM Target interface is created by the installer.  Also the USBDM
   target has been added to the new project wizard options.
   
\section InitialCFVxTargetConfig Selecting USBDM/CF target connection.
 
 For an existing project the USBDM Connection can be selected in the following way:
 
 - Create a new project or open an existing one.
 
 - Select the target you wish to use with USBDM and then press <b>Alt-F7</b> to open
   the settings dialogue shown:\n\n
   \image html Remote_Debugging_Connection.png

 - Select <b>Debugger->Remote Debugging</b> at the left and change the connection to <b>USBDM_Coldfire</b>.
 
 - Note that you will need to do the above for <b>each</b> Target in the project.

 - You should now be able to debug in the usual fashion.

   <tr>
   <td>
   When starting the debugger you will be presented with the dialogue at right.  After closing this 
   dialogue debugging will proceed as usual.  Some options may be disabled depending upon the
   hardware capabilities of the BDM interface.\n\n
   <b>Target Vdd Control</b> - Enables supply of Target Vdd from the USBDM module
      -  Enable - Enables voltage supply to target Vdd through BDM connection.\n\n
      -  3.3V or 5V - Select target supply voltage\n\n
      -  Cycle target Vdd on reset - This option will cause the BDM to cycle the target power as part of the reset sequence.\n\n
      -  Cycle target Vdd on connection problems - This option will cause the BDM to cycle the target power when
         it is having trouble connecting to the target.  \n\n
      -  Leave target powered on exit - The target Vdd supply will be left on when exiting the debugger.\n\n
      -  Prompt to manually cycle target Vdd - Some targets may only be made to enter BDM mode through holding
         BKGD low while applying power.  This option will cause a dialogue to appear prompting the user to remove
         and re-apply power to the target.  The BDM will be holding BKGD low while this prompt appears.  This option
         is not required if the BDM is supplying power to the target.\n\n

   <b>Connection Control</b>
      -  Automatically re-connect - Not currently used.\n\n
      -  Connection Speed - This sets the speed of communication with the target.  There is no method available for the
         BDM to determine the speed of the target and hence this must be specified here. 
         - <b>CFV1,2,3</b> \n
            For most Coldfire targets the
            speed should be less than 1/5 of the target clock frequency.\n
            <b>Note</b> that the speed chosen should match the slowest clock frequency in use by the target.  For example, many
            processors start up using the internal clock before switching to a faster external crystal and a clock multiplier.
            The speed should be chosen to be 1/5 of the slower <b>internal clock frequency.</b>
         - <b>JTAG</b> \n
            The JTAG chain on the target is (usually?) independent of the target clock.  It should be possibly to communicate 
            at the highest speed but this may be affected by cable length and quality of PCB routing.  Reduce speed if it is 
            found unreliable.
         - <b>MC56F80xx</b> \n
            This target uses the JTAG connection but currently the speed option is ignored.

   -  When first connecting with the target you may be prompted with a connection error dialogue if the connection can't
      be established.  This provides you with an opportunity  to return to the Connection Dialogue to change settings.  This option 
      will not be available if the connection is later lost.

      -  When connecting with the target you may be prompted to cycle the target power.  \n
         Simply turn off and turn on the target power and then press \b Retry to continue.  The Target BKGD pin will be held
         low while doing this.  \n This is useful for \e difficult HCS08 targets that may not respond to software reset
         when in certain modes. For example, this may occur when a blank chip has a COP timeout or some times when the
         processor clock is supended.  Another case would be if the BKGD pin can be programmed as an general purpose I/O pin.

      It is likely that the target is taking more current than the BDM can supply (~100 mA but depends on the regulator used). 
      This prompt may also appear if the target supply is momentarily shorted.  The BDM 
      detects this situation and <b>removes the target supply until a new debugging session is started</b>.
