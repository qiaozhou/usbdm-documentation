 \section sectionDSC_JMxx_Connector DSC JTAG Connector for USBDM_CF_JS16 (matching 14-pin connector)
   - The JS16 version BDM uses a keyed 14-pin connector for the DSC JTAG connector.  Targets will provide
    a matching connector with similar keying.

 \section sectionDSC_JS16_Connector DSC JTAG Connector for USBDM_CF_JMxx (non-matching 26-pin connector)
   - The JMxx version BDM only has a 26-pin Coldfire BDM connector.  It is necessary to make up an adapter cable to 
     mate with the smaller DSC JTAG connector.  The diagram below shows the required connections.  \n
     The DE and TRST pins are not used currently.
