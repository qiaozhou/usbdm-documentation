 \page Building the various projects

 \section introSection Introduction
   The source directory contains various archives of parts of the project:
   - 
   
 \section C Source folder
   This contains the sources for the software (above DLLs and JM60 code).
   
 \subsection EclipseFiles Eclipse Archive Files
   - <b>The following files are archives exported from Eclipse CDT for windows.  To rebuild these projects you will need the following:
         - <b>Eclipse CDT</b>  This is C development environment for the Eclipse IDE. CDT may be obtained from http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/
         - <b>MinGW</b>Minimalist GNU for Windows.  This provides the C development tools (e.g. Compiler, linkers etc.) required for the
              windows platform.  These are used with the Eclipse IDE on a windows platform. These tools may be obtained from http://www.mingw.org/
         - <b>Doxygen</b> This is a tool for producing documention directly from suitably annotated code.  The source code files have
              been extensively commented in this fashion. This tool may be obtained from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/.
         - <b>eclox</b> This is a plugin for Eclipse that allows the convenient use of Doxygen from within Eclipse.  This plugin may
              be obtained from http://eclox.eu/
         

         </b>    
   -  <b>USBDM_DLL_xxxxxx.zip</b> \n
      Source for the tbdml.dll, opensourcebdm.dll and tblcf.dll files. 
      To rebuild these DLLs you will also need the USB interface DLL (LIBUSB). Documentation is included in the
      Documentation sub-folder.  You will need Doxygen to build the documentation from the source.
      
   -  <b>USBDM_JMxx_Snapshot_xxxxxx.zip</b> \n
      Source for the JM60 code.  This is a simple Zip file of the Codewarrior project.  Documentation is included in
      the Documentation sub-folder.
      
   -  <b>HexToC_Snapshot_xxxxxx.zip</b> \n
      Source for the conversion program used to convert S1S9 records into a C array for incorporation in the driver DLLs.
      This is used to embed the BDM Firware images in the interface DLLs.  This allows
      automatic update of the JMxx version BDM firmware.
      
   -  <b>BDM Timing.xls</b> \n
      This spreadsheet was used to calculate the timing for the bdm_rx() and bdm_tx() routines. 
      
   -  <b>RS08_FlashProgramming.rar</b> \n
      This is the source code for the RS08 programming routines that are downloaded to the various RS08 variants
      by the BDM when programming the flash memory.
      
   -  <b>SetBoot_xxxxx.zip</b> \n
      This is the source code for the Setboot utility described above.
      
   -  <b>libusb-win32-device-bin-0.1.12.1.tar.gz</b> \n
      The USB interface library used.  See http://libusb-win32.sourceforge.net/

 \page installationPage Installation & Initial Programming of BDM Firmware

 \section sectionInitialProgramming Initial construction and programming.
   -  Build the hardware using the information provided in the <b>PCB</b> folder.  
   
   -  Program your JMxx with the binary file provided in the <b>Installation->USBDM_Flash_Images</b> directory.  
      This requires a HCS08 BDM.  \n
      To save space a 4-pin programming header has been used on the BDM.  An adapter is needed to connect to a
      standard BDM header.  This would consist of a 6-pin socket wired to a 4-pin header as shown below:  I have 
      found that if you slightly splay the 4-pin header it will make a quite reliable connection when directly 
      inserted into a PTH board without soldering. It may then be easily removed.\n
      Alternatively, wires may be temporarily soldered to the BDM.   \n
      Note that this programming is only needed once.  Updating of the firmware is done via USB.\n

   -  Install the modified driver files.\n
      Copy the files to the appropriate <b>Codewarrior</b> directories. A command file <b>Install Codewarrior Files.cmd</b> is provided to do this.  
      <b>Carefully check</b> this command file before executing it.  It may be necessary to modify paths depending upon which version of Codewarrior
      you have installed or if non-standard installation paths were used. \n
      This command file must be executed with administrator priviledges on Vista. (Right-click and choose Run as Administrator)      
      - The command file copies the following files\n
         <b>tblcf.dll, tblcf.cfg, tblcf_gdi.dll</b> -> \n
         "C:\Program Files\Freescale\CodeWarrior for ColdFire V7.1\bin\Plugins\Support\ColdFire\usbdm_cf" \n
         <b>opensourcebdm.dll</b> -> \n
         "C:\Program Files\Freescale\CodeWarrior for Microcontrollers V6.2\Prog\gdi" \n
         <b>tbdml.dll</b> -> \n
         "C:\Program Files\Freescale\CodeWarrior for S12(X) V5.0\Prog\gdi" \n
      - <b>Do not delete any existing DLL files</b> for example the .gdi files.  See the discussion in the "What is Provided" section for more details.

 \section sectionUpdate Update of BDM Firmware.
   -  The BDM driver files (tblcf.dll, opensourcebdm.dll & tbdml.dll) contain a copy of the BDM firmware.  The BDM interface
      will be automatically updated if it contains an earlier version of the Firmware.
   -  The Bootloader.exe program may be used to arbitrarily change the BDM firmware.  For example, 
      if you wish to restore an earlier version.  Its use is pretty obvious.
