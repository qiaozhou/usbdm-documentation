   -  Build the hardware using the information provided in the <b>PCB</b> folder.  
   
   -  Install the modified driver files.\n
      Copy the files to the appropriate <b>Codewarrior</b> directories. A command file <b>Install Codewarrior Files.cmd</b> is provided to do this.  
      <b>Carefully check</b> this command file before executing it.  It may be necessary to modify paths depending upon which version of Codewarrior
      you have installed or if non-standard installation paths were used. \n
      This command file must be executed with administrator priviledges on Vista. (Right-click and choose Run as Administrator)      
      - The command file copies the following files\n
         <b>opensourcebdm.dll</b> -> \n
         "C:\Program Files\Freescale\CodeWarrior for Microcontrollers V6.2\Prog\gdi" \n
         <b>tbdml.dll</b> -> \n
         "C:\Program Files\Freescale\CodeWarrior for S12(X) V5.0\Prog\gdi" \n
      - <b>Do not delete any existing DLL files</b> for example the .gdi files.  See the discussion in the "What is Provided" section for more details.

 \section sectionInitialProgramming Initial programming of USBDM into a blank device or a device containing an incompatible program.

 Refer to the following document for detailed information on how the JB16 is programmed using the Freescale ICP software 
 (or search for AN2399 on the Freescale web site): \n
   @htmlonly <a href="http://www.freescale.com/files/microcontrollers/doc/app_note/AN2399.pdf?fsrch=1">
   AN2399 : In-Circuit Programming of FLASH Memory via the Universal Serial Bus for the MC68HC908JB16</a> @endhtmlonly 

 -  Make a backup of the TBDML code.\n
      Make sure you have a copy of your current TBDML/OSBDM code so you can restore it if my code doesn't work with your hardware.

   -  Obtain the USBDM code for the JB16 flash memory.\n
      Choose a pre-compiled image from the USBDM_Flash_Images directory or re-build the code from scratch using the 
      source files provided in the source directory.  Refer to the documentation provided in the Zip file for details
      of the software and how to identify the appropriate configuration file to use.

   -  Initial download of code to JB16 flash\n
   This initial download of code to the JB16 installs a ICP boot loader.  It is intended that the boot loader code will remain
   permanently in the JB16 to help prevent (the unlikely) event of the JB16 becoming unusable due to Flash programming failing
   or being interrupted.\n
   If the code is updated again the Boot loader is not changed.  The instructions below ONLY APPLY to the INITIAL DOWNLOAD.  
   Updating the code later is a slightly different process that leaves the loader intact.\n
   Use whatever method your original TBDML hardware/software used to get into ICP mode.  For most hardware this was holding 
   port pin A.0 low while plugging in the BDM.\n
   The Freescale ICP programming software is used to download the code image to the JB16 Flash.  The software requires
   two files (both in \b Freescale ICP directory):\n
      -  A file to configure the ICP programming software for MASS erase configuration for this initial download  
      (\b Initial_Programming_MassErase.imp).
      -  The Flash file image for the JB16 Flash. This depends upon the hardware being used. Choose the appropriate
      file to download from the \b USBDM_Flash_Images directory.

 \section sectionUpdating Updating the USBDM code after the ICP code has been loaded the first time.
   -  Do one of the following:
      -  Hardware triggered ICP - Connect pin A.0 to ground and plug in the cable. The hardware will boot in ICP mode.\n
      OR
      -  Software triggered ICP - Plug in the BDM hardware and run \b Setboot.exe.  Carefully read the messages produced.  
         Answer yes to the prompt to confirm the change.  The hardware will re-boot into ICP mode. This is not a 
         persistent change so don't remove the BDM before re-programming.  \n
         \b Note: Older versions (<1.0) of the ICP code actually re-programmed the flash so that this was a persistent
         change.  It was necessary to remove and replace the BDM before programming.
   -  Use the Freescale ICP programming software to download the new OSBDM/TBDML code.
      It will usually be necessary to use the BLOCK erase configuration file for this (\b Re-programming_BlockErase.imp) so 
      that the ICP code is unchanged.  The setboot command will advise you if it is <b>desirable to replace the ICP code</b>.  If so
      use the Mass erase file (\b Initial_Programming_MassErase.imp).  This should be an infrequent event :).

 \section sectionRemoval Completely removing the USBDM code after the ICP code has been loaded.
   -  Follow the steps in the previous section to get into ICP mode.
   -  Use the Freescale ICP programming software to erase the entire Flash memory.
      It will be necessary to use the MASS erase configuration for this (\b Initial_Programming_MassErase.imp) so that the 
      ICP code is removed as well as it is only usable with the USBDM code.
   -  You may now restore your original Flash code and delete the two dll's installed above.
