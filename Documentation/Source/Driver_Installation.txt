 \page driverPage USB Driver Installation

To support the 64-bit version of Windows it has been necessary to update to using libusb1.0 drivers. For 
consistency this is also done on Linux and the other windows platforms. As part of this process the 
Vendor-ID/Product-ID (VID/PID) for the hardware (BDM) has been changed. This will allow the co-existence of
 Freescale's OSBDM-JM60 hardware while using a new driver for USBDM. Formerly both these BDMs used the same
  VID/PID and changes to the driver would not be possible without rendering the OSBDM-JM60 inoperable. \n\n
<b>Note:</b> On Windows, libusb1.0 is a thin wrapper around the Microsoft winUSB low-level USB drivers.  Because
of this you may see references to winusb in the following.\n

 \section NoteOnFirmwareChange Note for upgrading from version 3.x to 4.x USBDM firmware
 
This change is complicated by the existence of a Bootloader in the BDM firmware.  If not replaced this
loader will continue to use the original VID/PID.  Because of this, it is desirable to completely replace the
BDM firmware. \n\n
For JS16 based BDMs this is a simple process since the Freescale JS12 Bootloader software may be 
used to replace all the firmware.  See \ref installationPage. \n\n
For JMxx based BDMs it is necessary to use a HCS08 programmer to re-program the entire device so that the 
Bootloader is updated when the rest of firmware is changed. If a programmer is not available then it is still
possible to update the BDM firmware <i>using the Bootloader</i> but the Bootloader will remain unchanged.  
To do this it will be necessary to install the drivers twice - once for the old VID/PID used by the Bootloader
and again for the new VID/PID used by the main firmware.  Doing so will render any OSBDM drivers inoperable 
on that USB port.

\section InstallingDriversSectionLinux Installation of USBDM USB drivers for Linux
There isn't any.  The installation script provided will modify the /etc/udev/rules.d file to allow
access to the USBDM device. The required driver for USBDM BDM interface (LibusbV1) is included in the standard
Linux (at least Ubuntu current version).  The CDC (serial port) is a standard device and should also be installed
without any extra steps.

If more installation is required on your version you will have to investigate this yourself.  I'm not a Linux 
expert and I don't have access to other versions for testing.  If you find other steps are necessary then please
 advise and I will try to update the installation accordingly.

\section InstallingDriversSectionWindows Installation of USBDM USB drivers for Windows
  
This driver allows the USBDM software to communicate with the USBDM cable. You would usually only need to install these 
driver files once.  If you subsequently plug the USBDM cable into another USB port of the same computer 
the driver will be installed for that port automatically. \n\n

<b>The required drivers are copied to the installation location as part of the installation process.  The driver folder 
may be opened from the window's Start Menu.</b>
 
Setting up the drivers differs somewhat between the different versions of windows.  In versions before Windows 7
you will be automatically prompted to install the drivers using a <b>Found New Hardware Wizard</b> when you 
first plug in the USBDM.  For Windows 7 the installation will quietly fail and it is necessary to manually
trigger the wizard.    

<b> Prior to Windows 7 the following sequence should occur: </b>

 - 1. Plug in the USBDM.\n
 - 2. The <b>Found New Hardware Wizard</b> should appear.  Select the <i>Install from a list or a specific location</i>
   option. \n
   Select <b>Next</b> to continue. \n
   \image html FoundNewHardware1.png
   \n
 - 3. Select the options as shown and navigate to the driver directory.  <b>"C:\Program Files\pgo\USBDM 4.7.0\USBDM_Drivers"</b>. \n
   Select <b>Next</b> to continue. \n
   \image html FoundNewHardware2.png 
   \n
 - 4. The next step may take a while but you should eventually be presented with last dialogue shown. \n
   Select <b>Finish</b> to close the dialogue. \n
   \image html FoundNewHardware3.png 
   \n

The above sequence may be necessary a second time if you are installing a USBDM supporting a serial port connection.  
The serial port appears as a second device.

<b> With Windows 7 the following sequence should occur:</b>

 - 1. Plug in the USBDM.\n
 - 2. A small pop-up alert indicates windows is searching for the drivers.
   \image html DriverSoftwareInstall1.png
 - 3. Eventually this will be unsuccessful
   \image html DriverSoftwareInstall2.png
 - 4. You can click on the pop-up to view the result.  The CDC Interface is not present on all USBDMs.
   \image html DriverSoftwareInstall3.png
 - 5. To properly install the drivers it is necessary to open the Computer Properties ...  
   \image html OpenComputerProperties.png
 - 6. ...and then the Device manager.
   \image html OpenDeviceManager.png
 - 7. Locate the USBDM device(s), right-click and select <b>Update Driver Software...</b> from the menu.
   \image html DeviceManager1.png
 - 8. Select the second option as we need to specify where to find the drivers.
   \image html UpdateDriverSoftware1.png
 - 9. Browse to the driver directory <b>"C:\Program Files\pgo\USBDM 4.7.0\USBDM_Drivers"</b>.  Make sure <i>Include subfolders</i> is selected.
   \image html UpdateDriverSoftware2.png
 - 10. The driver is signed but the driver inf files aren't.  This results in a Windows Security dialogue.
   It is necessary to confirm the installation. 
   \image html UpdateDriverSoftware3.png
 - 11.  Eventually the installation should complete successfully.
   \image html UpdateDriverSoftware4.png
 - 12.  You can confirm the USBDM device in the device manager.
   \image html DeviceManager2.png
 - 13. Repeat this process with the USBDM CDC Device (Serial port) if present.
   \image html DeviceManager3.png
 - 14. You can confirm the USBDM serial port in the device manager.  The serial port number assigned is unique to the BDM 
   <b>providing it has a unique serial number</b>.  This allows multiple USBDMs to be present at the one time. \n
   After installation of the serial port you may examine or change the communication properties. 
   Right-click on the USBDM Serial Port and select Properties. 
   \image html DeviceManager4.png
 - 15.  The usual communication properties appear.  The USBDM serial port is limited in what baud rate and options are supported.
    (I will eventually tell you what ones here when I get a chance to check :)
    Advanced options are available.  Click on <b>Advanced...</b>
   \image html SerialPortProperties1.png
 - 16. One option worth noting is that you may also re-assign the COM port number used.

\section InstallingDriversSectionWindowsAlt Alternative Driver Installation Method for Windows

Alternatively, zadig may be used to install the libusbV1 drivers for the BDM interface (not the Serial port).
http://www.libusb.org/wiki/libwdi/zadig \n\n

<b>Preliminary</b> \n
   - Download the current version of the required driver installation program from 
   @htmlonly <a href="http://libusb.org/wiki/windows_backend#DriverInstallation">Windows Backend - libusb</a> @endhtmlonly 
   or using the direct link (at this time) 
   @htmlonly <a href="http://libusb-winusb-wip.googlecode.com/files/zadig.exe">zadig.exe</a>. @endhtmlonly \n
   - Plug in the programmed BDM.
   - Cancel any dialogues prompting to install the device drivers. \n
   - Under Windows 7 the automatic driver installation will proceed and fail.  \n \n

This following process will install the correct libusb 1.0 driver. 
 
 - 1.  Run the <b>zadig_XXX.exe</b> program. \n\n
       \image html Driver1.png
 
 - 2.  Select the BDM from the list of devices.  Under Windows Vista and Windows 7 the device description will be
       <b>USBDM BDM Interface</b>. Under Windows XP it may simply appear as <b>USB Device</b>.  
       - Check carefully that the Vendor ID and Product ID are <b>16D0</b> and <b>0567</b> respectively. There may also be a
       third number if the USBDM has a serial interface.  This should be zero(0) if present.  
       - If the description is anonymous click on the Edit Desc. checkbox and change it to something more meaningful.
       - Check that the WinUSB driver is the <b>Target</b>.\n  \n
        \image html Driver2.png
 
 - 3.  Click the <b>Install Driver</b> button.  This will install the driver files.  You may see a number of
       dialogues.

 \section InstallingOldDriversSection Installation of USBDM USB drivers for old VID/PID

This process should only be done if you need to use the USBDM Bootloader to update an old JMxx based BDM when you do not 
have access to a HCS08 programmer.  
\n\n

<b>Preliminary</b> \n
- Plug in the old BDM before proceeding.  \n
- Do not move the BDM to another port before updating the firmware as the driver installation will apply only to that port. 
- If the BDM has already been updated once, then it may be necessary to use the setboot.exe utility to place the BDM in ICP mode
  before installing the driver. 
\n

<b>Procedure:</b> \n
 - 1.  Run the <b>zadig_XXX.exe</b> program. \n\n 
       \image html DriverOld1.png
 
 - 2.  Choose <b>Options->List All Devices</b> from the menu so that all devices are available for installation. \n
       \image html DriverOld2.png
 
 - 3.  Select the BDM from the list of devices.  The description of the device will depend upon which device driver has been
       previously used.  In either case check carefully that the Vendor ID and Product ID are <b>15A2</b> and <b>0021</b> respectively.
       Click on the Edit Desc. checkbox and change the description to something more meaningful.  This will make the device easier to
       identify in the future.  
       \image html DriverOld3.png
       \image html DriverOld4.png
 
 - 4.  Make sure that <b>WinUSB</b> is selected as the <i>Target Driver</i>\n
       Click the <b>Install Driver</b> button.  This will install the driver for the selected device.  You may see a number of dialogues 
       as shown above.
       
 - The device should now be using the new driver and the USBDM Bootloader program may be used to update the firmware.
 - If desired, a similar process may be used to restore the original libusb driver if it is needed for other devices.
   Just select the correct <i>Target Driver</i>.

 \section LinuxDrivers Linux Drivers
 The shell scripts supplied with the linux version should install the required information for the libusb drivers to work on a linux machine.
 
 You will also need to make sure you have installed some libraries:
   (Some information posted by joncas on Freescale Forums - thanks)
  \verbatim
  Hello PGO,
  
  I just tried your version 4.6 with Codewarrior 10.1 on a clean install of Ubuntu 11.04 (32 bit).
  In case it helps anyone else trying this, it required adding the following libraries with the Synaptic Package Manager:
    - tcl8.5 
    - libwxgtk2.8-0 
    - lbwxgtk2.8-dbg 
    - libstdc++5 
    - libxerces-c3.1
  Then it seems to run fine.
  Many thanks and best regards!
