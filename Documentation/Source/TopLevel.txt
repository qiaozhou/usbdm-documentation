  \mainpage USBDM (combined TBDML/OSBDM/TBLCF/DSC code) for JB16/JS16/JM32/60

 \section introSection Introduction
   USBDM is a debugger hardware interface for a range of Freescale microcontrollers.  
   It is designed to work with Freescale's Codewarrior software under Windows and Linux.  More recently 
   basic support for Coldfire with Codesourcery Tool chain has been added (WIN only). 
   A set of stand-alone programmers are also provided.
       
   The attached files provide a port of a combined TBDML/OSBDM/TBLCF code to various processors.  
   The primary motivation for doing this was to produce a single BDM that could be used with the following processors:
   - RS08
   - HCS08,
   - HC12,
   - Coldfire V1-4 microcontrollers
   - MC56F800xx Digital Signal Controllers (very limited range).
   - Kinetis ARM-cortex
   
   Other features have also been added compared to the original TBDML/OSBDM designs.

   This site contains links to Version 4 of the following:
   - A set of software drivers for MS windows and Linux that work with various version of the Freescale Codewarrior IDE,
     including the latest Eclipse version.
   - Standard-alone programmers.
   - A description of, and design files for, several versions of suitable BDM hardware
   - The firmware required for the above BDM hardware.

\subsection JS16Designs JS16 based versions (Current designs)
   The following two designs use the <b>MC9S08JS16CWJ</b> (20 pin SOIC).\n
   This chip is USB2 Full speed and supports initial <b>programming over USB without needing a BDM</b>.

   <b>Minimal design - Supports HCS12, HCS08, Coldfire V1</b>
       - This is a very minimal design using a MC9S08JS16CWJ (20 pin SOIC). 
       - It is easier to construct than the JMxx versions
       - It may be programmed over the USB connection and <b>doesn't require a BDM</b> for initial programming. 
       - It replaces the Minimal JB16 designs and is recommended (by me) for newbies! 
       - A PCB design is supplied but is should be possible to roll-your-own on a prototyping board.\n
       - @htmlonly <a href="USBDM_V4.9/USBDM_JS16/html/index.html">Documentation is available here.</a> @endhtmlonly \n
       - (An alternative, larger design is provided that supports Serial over USB (CDC interface) that may be useful.)

   <b>Minimal design - Supports Coldfire V2,3,4, Kinetis and DSC (M56F80xx only) </b>
       - This is a very minimal design using a MC9S08JS16CWJ (20 pin SOIC). 
       - It is easier to construct than the JMxx versions
       - It may be programmed over the USB connection and <b>doesn't require a BDM</b> for initial programming. 
       - It is approximately equivalent to the earlier JB16 based TBLCF design in functionality. 
       - A PCB design is supplied but is should be possible to roll-your-own on a prototyping board.\n

 \subsection JMxxDesigns JMxx based versions (Current designs)
   The two following two designs use the <b>MC9S08JM60CLD</b> (44 pin LQFP).\n
   This chip is USB2 Full speed and requires a <b>HCS08 BDM for programming the device</b>.

   <b>USBDM - Supports HCS12, HCS08, RS08 & Coldfire V1</b>
       - This is a complete fully-featured design using a MC9S08JM60CLD (44 pin LQFP). 
       - It has target power and various other options.
       - It <b>REQUIRES a BDM</b> for initial programming.
       - Later firmware updates may be done over the USB \n
       - @htmlonly <a href="USBDM_V4.9/USBDM_JMxx/html/index.html">Documentation is available here.</a> @endhtmlonly. \n

   <b>USBDM-CF - Supports HCS12, HCS08, RS08 & Coldfire V1, V2, V3 & V4, Kinetis and MC56F800xx</b>
       - This is a complete fully-featured design using a MC9S08JM60CLD (44 pin LQFP).
       - It has target power and various other options. 
       - It <b>REQUIRES a BDM</b> for initial programming.

 \subsection JB16Designs JB16 based versions (These design are longer recommended)
   These versions were mainly produced to be compatible with the previous hardware versions of TBDML or OSBDM which
   were based on the MC908JB16.  This is a USB low speed device.
   The provided firmware versions allow (some) of these devices to be updated to a combined TBDML/OSBDM.  It also allows
   these to be used with the new Eclipse-based Codewarror which does not support the original osbdm or tbdml.   
 
   <b>There are several hardware designs supplied :</b>
    - Complete USBDM - Supports <b>HCS12, HCS08, RS08 & Coldfire V1</b> 
          - This is a complete fully-featured design using MC68HC908JB16DW (28 pin SOIC)
    - Minimal TBDML 20pin SOIC - Supports <b>HCS12, HCS08, Coldfire V1</b>
          - This is a very minimal design using MC68HC908JB16DW (28 pin SOIC)
    - Minimal TBDML 28pin SOIC - Supports <b>HCS12, HCS08, Coldfire V1</b>
          - This is a very minimal design using MC908JB16JDWE (20 pin SOIC)
 
   <b>BDM firmware versions are also supplied to support several existing hardware designs by other people:</b>
    - WTBDM08/12
          - A commercial design available from Witztronics.
    - OSBDM
          - A previous design posted on Freescale OSBDM board
    - HCS08-OSBDM+E
          - A previous design posted on Freescale OSBDM board

 \subsection Notes Notes 
   Please note that these design are different from the <b>Freescale OSBDM-JM60</b> design which was proceeding
   independently while I was doing the above designs.
   
 \section Credits Credits
   The bulk of the code is taken from the TBDML, OSBDM and TBLCF projects and I very much appreciate the
   effort involved in producing the original code. I hope this extension will be useful.

   The hardware interface is based on TBDML, Freescale USBSPYDER08 and my own invention.
