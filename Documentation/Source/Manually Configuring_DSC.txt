   The following procedure assumes that the USBDM DLLs have been installed in the recommended directory: \n
   <b>"C:\Program Files\Freescale\CodeWarrior for DSC56800E v8.3\bin\Plugins\Support\USBDM"</b> \n
   See the Installation instructions for more details.

\section InitialDSCTargetConfig Creation of a USBDM target connection.
 
 USBDM uses the GDI target connection interface in the debugger.  It is necessary to create a new
 GDI target connection to support this.  This needs to be done once only.\n
 
 - Start Codewarrior and then select <b>Edit->preferences...</b> to open the dialogue shown below:\n 
   Select <b>Debugger->Remote Connections</b> to show all the target connections.\n\n
   \image html DSCConfiguration1.png
   
 - Select <b>Add...</b> to add a new connection.  This will open the dialogue below:\n\n
   \image html DSCConfiguration2.png

 - Type in a suitable name. Note that the name must be a single word e.g. <b>USBDM_DSC</b>

 - Select 56800E GDI as the Debugger.

 - Click the <b>Browse</b> button to select the GDI DLL to be used.  Browse to the DLL directory: \n
   <b>"C:\Program Files\Freescale\CodeWarrior for DSC56800E v8.3\bin\Plugins\Support\usbdm"</b> \n
   and select the <b>usbdm-dsc-gdi-legacy.dll</b> file. \n
   Close each dialogue by selecting <b>OK</b>.

\section DSCTargetSelection Selecting the USBDM DSC target connection.
 
 Each target in a project must be set to use the USBDM_DSC target connection created above.\n
 
 - Create a new project or open an existing one.
 
 - Select the target you wish to use with USBDM and then press <b>Alt-F7</b>
   to open the settings dialogue shown:\n\n
   \image html DSCConfiguration3.png

 - Select <b>Debugger->Remote Debugging</b> and change the connection to <b>USBDM_DSC</b>.
 
 - Note that you will need to do the above for each Target in the project.

   <tr>
   <td>
   When starting the debugger you will be presented with the dialogue at right.  After closing this 
   dialogue debugging will proceed as usual.  Some options may be disabled depending upon the
   hardware capabilities of the BDM interface.\n\n
   <b>Target Vdd Control</b> - Enables supply of Target Vdd from the USBDM module
      -  Enable - Enables voltage supply to target Vdd through BDM connection.\n\n
      -  3.3V or 5V - Select target supply voltage\n\n
      -  Cycle target Vdd on reset - This option will cause the BDM to cycle the target power as part of the reset sequence.\n\n
      -  Cycle target Vdd on connection problems - This option will cause the BDM to cycle the target power when
         it is having trouble connecting to the target.  \n\n
      -  Leave target powered on exit - The target Vdd supply will be left on when exiting the debugger.\n\n
      -  Prompt to manually cycle target Vdd - Some targets may only be made to enter BDM mode through holding
         BKGD low while applying power.  This option will cause a dialogue to appear prompting the user to remove
         and re-apply power to the target.  The BDM will be holding BKGD low while this prompt appears.  This option
         is not required if the BDM is supplying power to the target.\n\n

   <b>Connection Control</b>
      -  Automatically re-connect - Not currently used.\n\n
      -  Connection Speed - This sets the speed of communication with the target.  There is no method available for the
         BDM to determine the speed of the target and hence this must be specified here. 
         - <b>CFV1,2,3</b> \n
            For most Coldfire targets the
            speed should be less than 1/5 of the target clock frequency.\n
            <b>Note</b> that the speed chosen should match the slowest clock frequency in use by the target.  For example, many
            processors start up using the internal clock before switching to a faster external crystal and a clock multiplier.
            The speed should be chosen to be 1/5 of the slower <b>internal clock frequency.</b>
         - <b>JTAG</b> \n
            The JTAG chain on the target is (usually?) independent of the target clock.  It should be possibly to communicate 
            at the highest speed but this may be affected by cable length and quality of PCB routing.  Reduce speed if it is 
            found unreliable.
         - <b>MC56F80xx</b> \n
            This target uses the JTAG connection but currently the speed option is ignored.

 \section PopupDialogues Popups

   -  When first connecting with the target you may be prompted with a connection error dialogue if the connection can't
      be established.  This provides you with an opportunity  to return to the Connection Dialogue to change settings.  This option 
      will not be available if the connection is later lost.

      -  When connecting with the target you may be prompted to cycle the target power.  \n
         Simply turn off and turn on the target power and then press \b Retry to continue.  The Target BKGD pin will be held
         low while doing this.  \n This is useful for \e difficult HCS08 targets that may not respond to software reset
         when in certain modes. For example, this may occur when a blank chip has a COP timeout or some times when the
         processor clock is supended.  Another case would be if the BKGD pin can be programmed as an general purpose I/O pin.

   -  The following dialogue is used to alert you to a supply overload when using the internal BDM power supply.
      It is likely that the target is taking more current than the BDM can supply (~100 mA but depends on the regulator used). 
      This prompt may also appear if the target supply is momentarily shorted.  The BDM 
      detects this situation and <b>removes the target supply until a new debugging session is started</b>.

\section DSCFlashProgramming Using the stand-alone 56800E Flash Programmer.
   It is also possible to use the 56800E Flash Programmer with USBDM but there is currently a 
   bug that only allows a single operation each time the programmer is launched.  This is 
   caused by the programmer not correctly closing the BDM connection after each operation.  This
   results in the BDM remaining in a busy state preventing subsequent operations.  I have not been
   able to find a solution to this problem so far.
